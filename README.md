I am a software engineering student with skills, abilities, and experiences gained through relevant training, internships, and projects added to leadership experience in team, time, and project management. My passion for coding carried me throughout my studies at Esprit. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, all with enough fascination, and it was here that I really learned how much there was still to learn. So now in the industry that passion stays with me. There's definitely more to learn, more problems to solve, and more to build.

Skills: Angular / Spring / JAVA/ HTML / CSS /Symfony

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
